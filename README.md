# Machine Learning Final Project

## Project Description

This is my final project for the Machine Learning course at MSU Denver.

This project is a neural network trained to classify handwritten digits.
See the [project report](FinalProject_Crandall_Theo.pdf) for more details.

## Running the Project

- To run the project run the [model running script](model-running.py). This will open a window where you can draw a digit and the model will attempt to classify it.
- To train a new model, run the [model training script](model-training.py)
- To use a newly trained model, update the `model_name` variable in the [model running script](model-running.py) to point to the newly trained model.
